# NOAA CPC map scraper

NOAA's Climate Prediction Center publishes some nice, high level maps, such as [this one regarding soil moisture levels](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Soilmst_Monitoring/US/Soilmst/Soilmst.shtml#), but doesn't provide historical access to previous editions. At least not that I can find. This "git scraping" repo makes an archive of them.
