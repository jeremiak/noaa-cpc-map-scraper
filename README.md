# NOAA CPC map scraper

[![Scrape daily soil moisture maps](https://github.com/jeremiak/noaa-cpc-map-scraper/actions/workflows/daily.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jeremiak/noaa-cpc-map-scraper/actions/workflows/daily.yml)

NOAA's Climate Prediction Center publishes some nice, high level maps, such as [this one regarding soil moisture levels](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/Soilmst_Monitoring/US/Soilmst/Soilmst.shtml#), but doesn't provide historical access to previous editions. At least not that I can find. This "git scraping" repo makes an archive of them.

Here are the most recent version of the maps that are scraped daily:

**Daily soil moisture (mm)**
